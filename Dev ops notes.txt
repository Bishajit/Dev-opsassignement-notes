Intro to computer hardaware
-Ports-connetion points that we can connect devices to that extend the funtionality of our computer.

Cpu- The brain of our computer it does all the calculations and data processing

Ram- Computer short term memory

Hardrive- Holds all our data

Motherboard The body or circuitboard of the computer that connects all the parts of the computer

Power supply- Conducts electricity to all parts of the computer

Programs and Harware

-Only communicates in binary
-Programs-instructions that tell the computer what to do.
-Chef(CPU)- puts reciepies in the ram (short term ram).
-External data bus- Uses 1,0. Row of wires that connects to the computer.
-Memory controller chip-The bridge or chip talks to the brain(cpu) and the ram.Grabs data from and sends it to cpu. 
-Address bus- Process that connects cpu to the mommory controller chip (MCC).
Cache- L1,L2, L3
CLockwire- Send and recieves data so it can do calculation. For every tick it does one cycle of operations. CLock cycyl
Clock speed- maxximum amount of clock cycles it can handle in a time period. 
Overclocking- 

CPU

-Instruction set- list of instructions
-Hard coded into cpu
-Makes sure cpu comptible with motherboard
-Heat sink- cools the cpu.

Ram
-Short term memory to access data quickly
_Volatile
-D-ram ; type of ram. 
-SDram
-DDR- 1,2,3,4
-Needs compatible motherboard

Motherboards 
-Foundation that keeps the computer to kept together. 
-Chipset- decides how components talk to eachother.
-Noerthbridge-Inter connects ram and video cards. 
-Southbridge- which maintain io or input and out puts data.
-Peripherals- External devices we connect to our computer, like a mouse, keyboard, and monitor
-Expandion slots- Give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer
-Peripheral component interconnect express
-Form factor- determines the amount of space in the mother board. most common form factor (ATX). Other one (ITX)

Storage
-Data sizes
-8 bits=1 byte
-1 kilobyte- consist of 1024 bytes
-SSD better than HDD
-ATA

Components of an operating system
- Operating system- THe whole package that manages our computer resources and lets us interact with it.
-Kernal space-File storage and file management
     -File system- organizes files and how it is managed. and not puting into one file and put into directories
     - Process management-  The order they run, how many resources they take up, how long they run. Does this with process management capabilities.
     -Memory management- Our Kernel optimizes memory usage and makes sure our application have enough memory to run
     -input/output management-Anything that can give us input or that we can use for output of data.

-USer space
     -Everything outside the Kernel (music player, System settings)

Operating system- Files and file systems
   *File Handling
      -Data
        -Meta data
          -File system- Used for different purposes and speeds. Windows (NTFS) future one(REFS)  Mac os (HFS+) linus (ext4)

        -File data- We write to our hard drive in the form of data blocks
	-Block Storage- Improves faster handling of data because the data isnt stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
  -Metadata
	-File extention-The appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems.

Operating system process management   

	-What's an operating system (Process Management) 
	-Process -A program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor.
	-Program- An aplication we can run like chrome.
	-Sytem runing multiple processes. 
 	-uses ram and cpu
	-cpu run process through time slice
	- A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for cpur exececution. 
	-Kernel-Creates processes, effeciently schedules them and manages how processes are terminated. 

Operating system-Memory Managament

	-Virtual memory- The combination of hard drive space and Ram that acts like memory that our processes can use.
	-Swap space- When we allocate space into our hard drive. We call that swap space

Operating system- IO management
-I/O devices that perform input and output (keyboard, headset..etc). Managed by kernel

Interacting with the OS User space
-shell- A program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute. EX (Bash, Bourn again Shell)
-Graphical user interface (GUI)

Operating system - Logs
-Logs- Files that record systems events on our computer, just like a system's diary

Operating System- The Boot Process
-Booting- 
-Power on
_BIOS?UEFI- A low level software that initializes our computer's hardware to makesure everything is good to go.
-Post (Power on Self Test)- Performs test to see if the comp is working properly, 
-Bootloader- Small program that loads the operating system.
-OS
-Kernel
-System processes
-User Space

 
Networking- Basics of Networking
Network-Computers can talk to eachother through being connected. 
-World Wide Web
-The internet- The physical connection of computer and wires around the world.
-The Web- The imformation on the internet.
	ex Email, chat
-Networking
	-Servers
	-Clients
	-Isp (Internet service providers)- forms networks
ip- identify address of a computer.
Mac address- hardcoded into devide. When you send or recieve data through a network you need to have both an IP and a MAC address.
-Packets-

Network Harware
-Ethernet cable
-WIFI
-FIber optic
-Router- Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic
-Switches
-hubs
-Network Stack- A set of harware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer

Networking- Language of the internet
-Roughted effeciently 
-Aren't corrupted
-Secure
-Right machine
-Named apropriately

-TCP/IP
IP-Delivers packets to right computer
TCP-Delivers imformation from one network to another

Networking- The Web
- HTML (Hyper text Markup language
-URL (Uniform resource loacator)
-ICANN- Intenet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
-DNS- DOmain Name System

Networking- What is the CLoud
-Cloud Computing_ A technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a sharable way, so that lots of users get what they need, when they need it . 
-Hardware virtualization- A single physical machine called a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests.
_Hypervisor-A piece of software that runds and manages virtual machines, while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware.
-Public cloud- A large cluster of machine run by another company
-Private cloud-used by single large corparation and genrally physically hosted on its own premises.
-Hybrid cloud A term used to describe situations where companies might run things like their most sensitive propriety technologies on a private cloud, while entrusting their less-sensitive servers to a public cloud. 

-Cloud-computing- new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources avalible in a better way. 


What is cloud computing
	The five characteristics of Cloud Computing 
-On-denand-self service:
	- Users can provision resources and use them with out human interaction from the service provider 
-Broad network access
	- Resources avalible over the network and can be aaccessesd by diverse client platforms
-Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
	-Multiple customers can share the same inferastructure and application with  security and privact
	-Multiple customers are service from the physical resources
-Rapid elasticity and scalability 
	-Automatically and quickly aquire and disposes resources when needed
	-Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
-Measured service
	-Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used. 

	Six advantages of cloud computing 
-Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
-Benefit from massice economies of scale
-Stop guessing capacity
-Increase speed and agility
-Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
-Go global in munute: leverage the AWS global infrastructure. 

		Problems solved by the cloud
-Flexibility: 
-Cost effectiveness
-Scalabiltiy
-Elasticity
-High-availiability and fault tolerance
-Agility
